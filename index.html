        <div class="story">
            <p>Brooklynites who checked off their holiday gift lists while shopping at Macy’s downtown Brooklyn location weeks ago did so for the last time. The financially troubled department store chain announced that the historic location will close soon, along with dozens of other stores across the U.S.</p>

            <p>Macy’s confirmed that the Fulton Mall location is among 66 stores that will shut down as part of the company’s “Bold New Chapter” strategy, announced last year. The closures also include the Macy’s Backstage location on Emmons Avenue in Sheepshead Bay.</p>

            <p>The New York based department store sold its iconic building on Fulton Mall in early December to United American Land. The real estate firm owns several historic buildings across New York, including a few in the popular Brooklyn retail district.</p> 

            <p>After the sale, Macy’s initially planned to lease back the four story, 440,000 square-foot property from the new owner. The real estate company expressed an interest in bringing family oriented entertainment to Fulton Mall, like a Universal or a Lego store.</p>

            <p>The downtown Brooklyn Macy’s, located at 442 Fulton St., is the last of several large department stores that once stood on the avenue. Some Brooklynites expressed sadness at the possibility of losing a store that holds a special place in the social fabric of the borough.</p> 

            <p>“I feel they’re making the most huge mistake ever. It feels terrible.” said Angeline Davis as she left the store with Christmas gifts in hand in mid-December. Davis has been shopping at the store for decades. “It’s a staple of our neighborhood.”</p>

            <p>“I started shopping here with my mom when I was a child,” said Junior Stevenson as he left the store carrying several bags. “It’s a Brooklyn institution. We’re going to miss it.”</p>

            <p>Prior to becoming a Macy’s in 1995, the department store was known as A&S, short for Abraham and Straus.</p> 

            <p>Ron Schweiger, the official Brooklyn Borough Historian, said A&S became a popular destination soon after the Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1893. “It was the most important of all the department stores along Fulton Street. It was the anchor of the community,” Schweiger said.</p> 

            <p>"I remember every one of those old department stores and now the very last one may disappear,” Schweiger said. “I have fond memories of being in Abraham and Strauss with my mother. Even with my wife, when we got married in 1969, we used to go shopping down there. You'd go there for wedding rings.”</p>

            <p>The latest round of store closings was expected. Last year, Macy's CEO Tony Spring said that they expected to start closing over 60 stores soon after the holiday season ended.</p> 

            <p>The company’s third quarter earnings report was delayed after an independent investigation revealed that “a rogue employee” hid up to $151 million in expenses related to delivering small packages. A report <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/794367/000162828024050691/n-20241211.htm">filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> said,"a single employee with responsibility for small package delivery expense accounting intentionally made erroneous accounting accrual entries and falsified underlying documentation.”</p> 

            <p>Spring said the employee acted alone and is no longer with the company.</p>
